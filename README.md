# About me
My remarkable curiosity and satisfaction in solving puzzling problems â€” hand in hand with strong analytical and quantitative skills â€” have drawn me to science. Hence, I have become PhD in chemistry and gained extensive experience in research and all related tasks such as experiment planning, data analysis, problem-solving, presenting of results, scientific writing, supervision of students, laboratory and project management. Gradually, I started to employ Python in the data evaluation and also realized an interest to shift my work from fundamental research closer to real applications.

I am looking for new work opportunity in a company which seeks individuals who can take responsibility, be initiative, creative in finding original solutions, eager to learn new things and are also reliable, self-reliant and organized. I am excited to apply and expand my skills in Python and SQL for data analysis and data science tasks.
